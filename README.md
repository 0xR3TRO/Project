## Project Description

### Objective:

The "Watch Store" project aims to provide users with a responsive web platform for browsing and purchasing a variety of watches. The store will be optimized for display on various devices, ensuring users a comfortable and intuitive shopping experience.

### Feature Description:

- **Product Browsing:** Users can browse watches from different categories such as sports, elegant, smartwatches, etc.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Ability to filter products by various parameters such as price, brands, colors.
- **Shopping Cart:** Adding products to the shopping cart and managing them before finalizing the transaction.
- **Responsiveness:** Adapting the store interface to different devices such as computers, tablets, and phones, providing an optimal user experience on each device.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Product Browsing:** Users can browse watches from different categories.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Ability to filter products by various parameters, such as price, brands, colors.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to the cart and manage them before finalizing the purchase.
- **Responsiveness:** The store interface should be responsive and adapt to different devices.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Interface Responsiveness:** The store should be optimized for display on various devices.
- **Performance:** Minimizing page loading time and processing operations.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of Interface:

- _Home Page:_ Promotional product presentation, navigational menu.
- _Product Category Page:_ Displaying watches from a specific category in a grid or list format.
- _Product Page:_ Detailed information about the selected watch, options for choosing size, color, adding to the cart.
- _Shopping Cart:_ Reviewing added products, ability to remove, edit quantities, and finalize the transaction.
- _Checkout Page:_ Payment and delivery form.

### Site Map:

- _Home Page_
  - Promotional products
  - Navigational menu
- _Product Category Page_
  - List of watches from a specific category
  - Filters and sorting
- _Product Page_
  - Information about the watch
  - Options for size, color selection
  - Add to cart
- _Shopping Cart_
  - List of products
  - Ability to remove, edit quantities
  - Finalize transaction
- _Checkout Page_
  - Payment and delivery form

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to products, shopping carts, and transactions, including:

- **Products:** Information about watches, such as name, price, description, images.
- **Shopping Cart:** List of products added by the user along with their details.
- **Transactions:** Data regarding completed transactions, such as products, delivery address, payment status.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on a client-server model, where:

- **Server:** Handles user requests, manages data, and business logic.
- **Client:** User interface available on various devices, communicates with the server via HTTP protocol.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js) - providing responsiveness and interactivity of the interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js) - handles client requests, manages data.
- **Database:** MongoDB - stores information about products, shopping carts, transactions.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for interface components, business logic, request handling.
- _Coding Style_: Use of modularity, readability, comments.

## Testing:

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Checking the correctness of business logic functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensuring that components cooperate correctly.
- **User Interface Tests:** Checking user interaction on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluating application performance under load.

### Testing Procedures:

- Developing a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establishing procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, corrections, publication on a hosting platform.
- **Deadlines:** Determining dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establishing communication channels with users for reporting issues.
- **Updates:** Planning regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Division of work into specific tasks (e.g., interface implementation, business logic, testing).
- **Deadlines:** Determining the time required for each stage.

## Cost Estimate:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours of work or team of developers.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, hosting service fees, technical support.
